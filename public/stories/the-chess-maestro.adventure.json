The eyes of two superpowers will be watching. But tonight, you have other business.\n\nYour handler, a man you know only as \"The Bishop,\" sent word through the usual channels: a dead drop at midnight, coordinates hidden in a chess problem published in this morning's Wiener Zeitung.\n\nYou decoded it an hour ago. The location is a bookshop in the Jewish Quarter—three blocks from here.\n\nBut something feels wrong. Two men in grey overcoats have been nursing coffees in the lobby for three hours. KGB? Austrian intelligence? Or just chess enthusiasts hoping for an autograph?",

You took the easy path. The coward's path.\n\n\"I need your help,\" you say. \"I need to know who I can trust.\"\n\n\"Trust no one.\" She finishes her drink. \"But if you must trust someone... trust me. I'll get you out of Vienna. Out of Europe. Somewhere they can't find you.\"\n\nYou have no choice. You've already lost too much.\n\nThree days later, you're on a fishing boat crossing the Mediterranean. Vienna is behind you. Chess is behind you. Everything is behind you.\n\nBut you're alive.

You know I was sent to destroy you.\" She takes a step closer. \"But did he tell you why I haven't?\"\n\n\"Why haven't you?\"\n\n\"Because Volkov is a monster. Because the system is rotten. Because I've seen what they do to people who ask questions.\" Her eyes are fierce. \"I'm not your enemy, Viktor. I'm your way out.\"\n\nYou could kill her. End the threat. But something in her voice stops you.\n\n\"Prove it,\" you say.\n\nShe does. By morning, you're both on a plane to Washington, with enough intelligence to keep the CIA happy for years.\n\nNadia becomes a valuable asset. You become a symbol of freedom.

She continues to report to Volkov, but the intelligence she provides is carefully crafted—true enough to be believed, false enough to be useless.\n\nBy the time the KGB realizes they've been played, you've won the championship, defected to the West, and exposed enough Soviet agents to set their European network back by years.\n\nNadia disappears after Vienna. You hear rumors—that she's in South America, in Asia, in Africa. Always moving. Always running.\n\nYou hope she found peace. You never did.\n\nBut the chess, at least, was beautiful.

Eventually, you retire to a quiet life in Switzerland, teaching chess to wealthy children.\n\nSometimes, on winter evenings, you think about Mueller. About the daughter he was trying to save.
