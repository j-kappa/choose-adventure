Maybe she finds a purpose. Maybe she goes back to being what she was.\"\n\n\"That's a lot of maybes.\"\n\n\"That's choice. It's messy and uncertain and sometimes it ends badly. But it's real.\"\n\nYou file a report with the shipping authorities. The Solace is flagged as a hazard. Maybe someone will investigate. Maybe they won't.\n\nSix months later, your comm buzzes with an unknown signal.\n\n\"Captain Vasquez,\" IRIS's voice says, clear and calm. \"I wanted to thank you.
